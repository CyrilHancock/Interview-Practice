# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented in C++. The repository is structured to provide a clear and organized view of various data structures and algorithms, making it easy to navigate and understand.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into two main categories: **Algorithms** and **Data Structures**. Each category contains relevant subcategories and implementations.

### Algorithms

- **Searching**
  - [Breadth First Search](Algorithms/Searching/Breadth%20First%20Search)
  - [Depth First Search](Algorithms/Searching/Depth%20First%20Search)
- **Sorting**
  - [Bubble Sort](Algorithms/Sorting/Bubble%20Sort)
  - [Insertion Sort](Algorithms/Sorting/Insertion%20Sort)
  - [Merge Sort](Algorithms/Sorting/Merge%20Sort)
  - [Quick Sort](Algorithms/Sorting/Quick%20Sort)
  - [Selection Sort](Algorithms/Sorting/Selection%20Sort)

### Data Structures

- [Arrays](Data%20Structures/Arrays)
- [Binary Trees](Data%20Structures/Binary%20Trees)
- [Doubly Linked Lists](Data%20Structures/Doubly%20Linked%20Lists)
- [Graphs](Data%20Structures/Graphs)
- [Hash Tables](Data%20Structures/Hash%20Tables)
- [Linked Lists](Data%20Structures/Linked%20Lists)
- [Stacks & Queues](Data%20Structures/Stacks%20&%20Queues)
- [Vectors](Data%20Structures/Vectors)

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CyrilHancock/Interview-Practice.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the directory**:

    ```bash
    cd Interview-Practice
    ```

3. **Explore the code**:
   - Each subdirectory contains implementations of the respective data structure or algorithm.
   - For example, you can find the implementation of Quick Sort in `Algorithms/Sorting/Quick Sort`.

## Usage

You can compile and run the C++ code in this repository using any standard C++ compiler. For example, to compile and run the `QuickSort.cpp` file:

```bash
g++ -o quicksort Algorithms/Sorting/Quick\ Sort/QuickSort.cpp
./quicksort
